Hi, I'm AmanAnku
Software Engineer At Nextory Private Limited

For more than five years as a self-taught developer, I'm constantly learning and perfecting my skill as a developer every day. I enjoy challenges and goals that force me to increase my knowledge and skills. I like to create things with JavaScript/TypeScript technologies that can help people do their chores easier and faster.




ABOUT

In 2019 I made a bold career move from selling beer to being a software engineer. I got lucky, because not only do I love the work, but I love writing about it, talking about it, and encouraging others to make their own bold career changes.


I'm currently a "full stack" Software Engineer with a passion for frontend. I work in Angular, C# and AWS, while my side projects are mostly in React, and I dabbled in Gatsby and GraphQL to make this site. Other passions and hobbies include: thinking about UX, writing about my experiences in tech, playing with colors and design for way too long, and renovating my recently purchased 1930s home in Portland, Oregon.


Hi! I am Chirag Samal. I have a passion for technology and the positive impact it creates in business transformation and technology improvement. Highly skilled in strategic software development and leading high-performing and energetic teams.

Music, Movies, Gadgets, Iron Man, Batman

When I am not writing code I love to spend time with my family and friends in Lagos. I hang around a couple of DAOs on Discord and actively contribute to the MoonShot Collective work-stream of GitcoinDAO and I love to read fiction and non-fiction books, watch sci-fi movies and play games on my playstation console.
