Hi, I'm AmanAnku
Software Engineer At Nextory Private Limited

For more than five years as a self-taught developer, I'm constantly learning and perfecting my skill as a developer every day. I enjoy challenges and goals that force me to increase my knowledge and skills. I like to create things with JavaScript/TypeScript technologies that can help people do their chores easier and faster.
